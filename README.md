## 1 Intro
- Why use TS?
    - Type checking at compile time is way better than things crashing of worse - behaving unexpectedly at run time
    - better development experience because autocomplete knows more about what you are intending to doing
    - Larage codebases stay more maintainable because you are able to put guardrails on how your code can be used
